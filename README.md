# hipercog_behavioral_modelling
Various models and results when fitting behavioral models to rat learning data

## Write_up
Contains the .tex documents describing the models trained, the procedure used to train the models, as well as presenting the findings of the various model fittings.

## data
All data used and generated in the modelling.

## plots
Contains all plots generated during the modelling, namely plots of the fitted parameters comparing hard vs easy groupings, plots comparing order effects as well as the log-likelihood plot comparing how well the various models fitted the data.

## src
The source code for the modelling.

### models
Contains the python files of all the fitted models as well as the cog_sci_model_base which all models inheret from.

### run_experiments
Contains the run_experiments.py file which systematically instantiates and fits all the models. Also contains all the functions related to plot production.
